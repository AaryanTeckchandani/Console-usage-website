    After downloading and installing visual studio, you will end up in the home screen. Next, hover around the top left of the screen and you will see something saying file. After that, click on new file and name it. You can now get to coding. When you are done, save your work by clicking on file, and pressing save/save all. At the bottom right of the screen something would either say Go Live, click on that to view your work. Now, if you need to look for any errors, right click on your screen, and press inspect. Now, you can upload your code on GitHub.
