    After downloading and installing visual studio, you will end up in the home screen. Next, hover around the top left of the screen and you will see something saying file. After that, click on new file and name it. You can now get to coding. When you are done, save your work. Finally, at the bottom right of the screen something would either say port 5500 or Go Live, click on that to view your work.
